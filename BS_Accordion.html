                    <p>Will Maharashtra finally get a new government today? The Shiv Sena, the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) and the Congress have been working on a prospective coalition. Maharashtra is currently under President's Rule, which was imposed earlier this month after the two parties that won the state election together -- the Sena and the BJP -- disagreed on a key issue and so couldn't form a government together. Stay tuned to this live blog for the latest updates from Maharashtra.</p>
